## Syntax highlighting

Jekyll has [built in support](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting) for syntax highlighting of over 60 languages thanks to [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/).

To render a code block with syntax highlighting, surround your code as follows:

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}
{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

[Pygments](http://pygments.org/) styles are present under section 6.0 of `css/style.scss` for customization.

### Examples

#### Bash

{% highlight bash %}
>_ ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa account@host.com
account@host:~$
$ var="my-value"
$ echo $var
my-value
$ logout

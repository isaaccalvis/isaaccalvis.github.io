### Who am I

<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm Isaac Calvís, born in 1998. I currently live in Sant Cugat, near Barcelona.
<br><br>
I started playing video games when I was a kid, with a GameBoy Advance, and have continued playing since then!
<br><br>
I have a special love for Immersive Sims games (such as Bioshock, Dishonored or Prey), but also love other kinds of games, almost all of them. I've played a lot of different games, enjoying what this industry can offer gamers. I don't consider myself a 'hardcore' player, I prefer experimenting with different games trying many different ideas.

### Development

<div style="text-align: justify">
I started video game development at the age of 14 making games with Blender by scripting its logic blocks. Later on, I started working with Unity and made some games with C++ for Window’s console.

<br><br>
Then I entered University, I started a VideoGame Development & Design bachelor at CITM/UPC (Polytechnic University of Catalonia), where I develop different projects. After my bachelor's I decided to do a Master in Computer Engineering to complement my studies as Software Development. I've learned tons of different paradigms that make me more prolific developing software.
<br><br>
I want to learn about GamePlay and Artificial Intelligence, Tool Development, but also have a special interest for Level Design and Motivation Psychology.

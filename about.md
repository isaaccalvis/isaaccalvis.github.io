### Who I am

<div style="text-align: justify">
I'm Isaac Calv√≠s, born in 1998. At this moment I live in Sant Cugat, near Barcelona.
<br><br>
I started playing video games when I was a kid, with a GameBoy Advance, and I continued playing since then!
<br><br>
I have special love for Immersive Sims games (as Bioshock, Dishonored or Prey), but also love other kind of games, almost all of them, I've played a lot of different games, enjoying what this industrie can give to people.
I don't consider myself a 'hardcore' player, I prefere to experiment with different games, and try a lot of different ideas.

### Who I am
I'm Isaac Calv√≠s, I was born in 27/12/1998. At this moment I live in Sant Cugat, near Barcelona (Catalunya).
I started playing video games when I was a kid, with a GameBoy Advance.
My favourite videogame is Bioshock, the original one.
But also I love a lot of other types of games, such as strategy, stealth or shooting games.

### Development
I started videogame development at the age of 14, making games with Blender and it's logic blocks.
Later I started working with Unity, and made some games with C++ for windows console.
Then I entered at University, I started a VideoGame Development & Design bacherol at CITM/UPC (Politecnical University of Catalonia), and this year I'm finishing it.
